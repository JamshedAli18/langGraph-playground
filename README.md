# LangGraph-Playground 

Welcome to your journey to mastering LangGraph concepts! This repository is a comprehensive learning resource designed to help you understand and master LangGraph, a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of LangChain. It extends LangChain's Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner.


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.9 or higher recommended
python --version

# Install LangGraph and dependencies
pip install langgraph langchain langchain-openai
```

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key)
3. Start with the fundamentals in `docs/01-fundamentals/`
4. Try out the examples in `examples/basic/`
5. Progress through intermediate and advanced topics

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each concept can be found in the `docs/` directory:

- **[Fundamentals](docs/01-fundamentals/)** - Core concepts and basic usage
- **[Intermediate](docs/02-intermediate/)** - Building more complex graphs
- **[Advanced](docs/03-advanced/)** - Expert-level features and patterns
- **[Applications](docs/04-applications/)** - Real-world use cases
